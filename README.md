# Football-League-Database

The project involves the creation of a robust and user-friendly database management system to facilitate the organization's operations related to sports management. It will serve as a centralized repository for information on teams, players, matches, stadiums, leagues, league standings, team achievements, and player achievements. Users will be able to interact with the system to perform various tasks such as adding teams, recording match results, updating standings, and tracking player achievements.
